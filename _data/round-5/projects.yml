Scholars who wish to work openly do not have time to investigate the topic in addition to their already full teaching and research schedules. Few online resources exist to address these issues in an academic context. We hope to empower researchers/instructors to take charge of their own digital safety through the creation of an online toolkit that can be used at point of need and incorporated into higher education coursework."

- name: "ETER || open educational resources on citizen science & environmental monitoring for teachers"
  description: "Our project aims to disseminate open source practices among high school teachers by co-prototyping with them an open air quality monitor, publishing open air quality data they can reuse with students and documenting the  experience in an OER kit. We want teachers to experience the potential that open practices have to address local community issues. Teachers can play a key role in influencing students towards local social innovation, but most of them feel 'outdated' regarding ICTs."

  description: "FlyCAGE is a web application that allow users to search for genes in fruit flies that follow a specific expression pattern. The user can either enter a known gene name to find other genes with similar expression profiles, or the user can enter a custom expression pattern based on experimental data to find genes that follow the pattern. FlyCAGE would be useful in identifying candidate genes involved in a given process and discovering regulatory interactions in genetic networks."

The main aim of the project is to bridge the gap in women in tech which has been decreasing in the past decades.  At the end of the program each attendee will have a working web application. It will also open doors for the attendees to the many women in tech opportunities."

  description: "Documentation requires a lot of human energy. Tons of programs are fully featured and yet little documented.

An HACKccessibility wizard will help developers to document undocumented code and a webapp populated by data from an analysis of git repositories will provide insight on pieces of code with regards to their documentation and code patterns.

A set of free software projects exposing little documentation will be contacted and proposed to use the wizard for documentation sprints. "

  description: "My project draws on our students’ activist nature and commitment to addressing social inequities and empowering students to be open leaders. Our students tend to be very interested in engaged when discussing information privilege. Thus, the purpose of an information activism student club would be twofold: students will lead campus efforts to 1) to promote Open Access and reduce barriers to information by supporting openness and 2) to advocate for OER adoption across the institution."

  description: "At Pockets Change we’re changing the way money is taught. We combine Hip Hop, Finance, and Design Thinking to build financial capability in K-12 and early adulthood.

Our workshops and lessons are a start but useful and accessible finance personal assessments are severely lacking in education. Those that exist do little to support the development of self-efficacy and understanding, rather they focus on calculating compound interest and other out of date skills. Let’s build them!! "

It is an android application (for now)which enables chat & message passing without any network, off the grid.
It creates a decentralized, end to end encrypted scalable peer to peer mesh network.It can use a combination of wifi and bluetooth interchangeably to create the mesh network. It is not bound to any one of them, can use both separately or mixed in a network. Also if 1 node has Internet that can be shared among everyone"

I first want to inventory all the sources of Africa knowledges (websites, forum, etc... ) before building the plateform that will probably be a web plateform."

Many researchers view Open as a potential risk and they may not see their fields represented in well-known Open advocates. By collecting Open success stories and making them discoverable by storyteller location, discipline, career level, and language, we can better represent the success stories of open practitioners and encourage other researchers to go Open."

As lines between ‘online life’ & ‘real life’ become increasingly irrelevant, we're realizing how much data is generated by--and about--each of us. This data may be about me, but whose is it, really? What rights over it & its use do I have?
